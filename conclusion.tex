Visual data exploration allows users to analyze datasets based on visualizations of interesting data characteristics, to possibly discover interesting information about the data.
As the users are a priori unaware of the content of the explored data, the visual data exploration requires an investigative way of navigating through (portions of) the data to discover iteratively valuable information.

Nonetheless, existing visual data exploration tools typically require a tedious process of query and visualization specifications, preventing analysts from efficiently exploring different aspects of the data. 
 As a result, users without enough querying skills or visualization background may fail to accomplish their exploration and overlook important insights or trends hidden in the analyzed data.
 
To address this challenge, this thesis contributed a set of approaches that support users in the visual data exploration process.
Next, we summarize the contributions discussed in this thesis towards improving user 'experience when exploring data visually.
Subsequently, we discuss interesting perspectives and open questions for future investigation.
