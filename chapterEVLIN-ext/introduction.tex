So far, the query recommendation approach leverages data provenance to make content-based recommendations. In this section, we now present how to further exploit our evolution provenance to incorporate collaborative-filtering based recommendations.


For that, we give in the Section~\ref{sec:overview} a brief overview about our proposed collaborative-filtering query recommendation. 
After that, we describe in Section~\ref{sec:fuse} how we generate an evolution provenance graph that results from the aggregation of many evolution provenance records. 
Then, we discuss in Section~\ref{sec:finding} our proposed collaborative-filtering query recommendation process.
Furthermore, we discuss related work in Section~\ref{sec:collab-related-work}.


Finally, we point out that the content of this section is mainly based on methods and approaches described in~\cite{Houssem:19:adbis,Houssem:19:IS}.
