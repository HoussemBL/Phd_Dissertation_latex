In this chapter, we present our approach that infers a structure-based summary from a set of provenance traces available in PROV-JSON format.
We discuss our proposed solution as well as possible visual analytics tasks that may be applied to this type of summary. 
We show how our approach can contribute to the analysis of a set of evolution provenance graphs generated using our visual data exploration framework \framework{}. Furthermore, we broaden the discussion of the utility of our approach by providing other illustrative use cases treating other types of provenance.
%We implement also our approach using a map-reduce fashion. 
Our preliminary experimental evaluation studies both the runtime and conciseness of summarization. Several points for future research have been mentioned throughout this work, including the integration of schema inference and schema integration techniques to our approach as well as a thorough study and evaluation of different visualizations for different analytical tasks.
