We present in this section \prototype{} (short for \underline{e}xploring \underline{v}isually with \underline{lin}eage) that is an instance of our framework \framework{} meant to explore \emph{data warehouses}. The rationale behind that is to clarify the general idea of our framework \framework{} by introducing a running example that is targeted towards the visual exploration of a data warehouse.
This running example will later serve to further illustrate our scientific contributions proposed in this thesis.


%{\color{Fuchsia} To do that, we resort to our framework's architecture (cf.~Figure~\ref{fig:archi-FW}) to explain how each module/component present in our framework's architecture is implemented in~\prototype{}.  Alongside this description, we provide several examples that illustrate each implemented module. Furthermore, we define important concepts strongly related to our contributions discussed subsequently. }
