We propose in this chapter \framework{} (\underline{P}rovenance-based \underline{V}isual \underline{D}ata \underline{E}xploration), our novel framework meant to explore data visually.
In contrast to existing work that assist users in one particular stage of the exploration (e.g., in querying or visualizing data), our framework \framework{} adopts a holistic approach that supports users in all phases of the visual data exploration process. To do so, \framework{} provides several features to help users in performing the visual data exploration process efficiently. 
Figure~\ref{fig:archi-FW} depicts the general framework, which comprises several components and requires a user to interact with the system. 

%In the next section, we describe in detail each module present in the architecture of our visual data exploration framework \framework{}.
