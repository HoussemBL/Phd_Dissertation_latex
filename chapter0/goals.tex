{\color{Fuchsia}Two main goals of this thesis. Firstly, we aim at making provenance data more accessible and useful, especially in applications performing complex data processing on vast amounts of data by providing suited visualization techniques.
Second, we aim at showing how data transformations applied in visual computing can benefit from provenance information.}	
	
	
	The aim of our research work is to provide solutions that respond to the described problems. The proposed so- lutions should comply with characteristics of genericity, standardization and granularity while being endowed with adaptation flexibility and performance optimization. We described these characteristics in the following:
	\begin{itemize}
\item Granularity
\item Genericity
\item Performance optimisation: not only the proposed solution is learning-based, it should also optimize the learning performance in order to optimize the system?s performance. The objective is to render a solution that has the potential to scale for complex applications.

\end{itemize}
