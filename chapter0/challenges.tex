{\color{Fuchsia}In what follows, we intend to leverage provenance given its capabilities to improve and to increase the transparency of data processing applications.}

Given provenance data, two interesting and unresolved questions that this project addresses are: (ii) how can visual computing applications leverage provenance for reproducibility and predictability? and (ii) how can we efficiently and effectively visualize provenance data  In studying these problems, both the volume and variety of produced provenance data represent major challenges.
