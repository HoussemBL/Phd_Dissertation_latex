%{\color{Fuchsia}This thesis discusses our scientific contributions proposed to improve users' experiences when visually exploring data.
%Note that, our contributions leverage as we will discuss later several types of provenance to provide a more efficient visual data exploration.
%To this end, we dedicate this section to introducing provenance, its types, its applications and its requirements.

%We have seen in introduction that we study how to collect and leverage provenance for visual data exploration process.

%%%3eme ESSAIE`
As introduced in Chapter~\ref{chap:intro}, we aim at studying methods required to collect and leverage provenance to improve the visual data exploration process. More specifically, among the large body of work on provenance (see our survey~\cite{Herschel2017survey}), we focus in what follows on research on two specific provenance types, namely \emph{workflow provenance}, and \emph{data provenance}.

% \subsection{Provenance definition}
%%As stated in~\cite{Herschel2017survey}, provenance generally refers to any information that describes the production process of an end product, which can be anything from a piece of data to a physical object. 
%As stated in~\cite{Herschel2017survey}, the collection and processing of provenance is important in various settings, e.g., to examine the sequence of steps that led to a result, to debug a tracked process and in some cases to reproduce a result. 
%
%
%We have extensively surveyed provenance literature. This results in our survey~\cite{Herschel2017survey}, that %gives a clear picture of 
%describes which provenance types may be employed for what purpose and what system requirements should be considered by provenance collection techniques. 
%In what follows, we rely mainly on results of our survey to present provenance types in Section~\ref{prov:types}, provenance applications in Section~\ref{sec:prov-purposes} and provenance requirements in Section~\ref{sec:prov-requirements}.
