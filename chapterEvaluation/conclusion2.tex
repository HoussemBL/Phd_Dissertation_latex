%In this chapter, we performed a set of evaluations to validate our contributions.  
%{\color{Fuchsia} More specifically, we evaluated first our content-based query recommendation approach, our visualization recommendation solution and our methods quantifying recommended queries.  Second, we investigated our merge methods meant to fuse evolution provenance graphs, our collaborative-filtering query recommendation method and its impact on improving the quantification of recommendation.
%
%Overall, our contributions were evaluated  both quantitatively using performance measurements and qualitatively with a user study on both synthetic and real data. 
%Quantitative experiments show the feasibility and the efficiency of our proposed solutions for visual and interactive data exploration while qualitative evaluations show a general satisfaction among users when visually exploring data warehouses data using our approaches gathered in our system \prototype{}. }
%
%
%  The evaluations showed promising results. It opens also the path to a variety of research questions, which we intend to tackle in the future. For instance, our evolution provenance merge was promising 
% and paves the way to the support of the collaborative-filtering query recommendation.
%  Accordingly, we consider that provenance aggregation may serve other applications apart from collaborative-filtering query recommendation.
%   To this end, we worked also on the aggregation of several types of provenance. This results in a new provenance summary approach thoroughly discussed in the next chapter.
