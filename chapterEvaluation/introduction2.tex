We dedicate this section to evaluate our collaborative-filtering recommendation approach proposed to improve the user's experiences during the visual data exploration. 

{\color{Fuchsia}It is worth stressing that we rely mainly in the course of evaluation on \prototype{}, the instance of our framework \framework{} as it implements all our contributions discussed in this chapter.}


 
We start by providing a brief description of the experimental setup in Section~\ref{sec:setup}. 
%It includes implementation details of \prototype{}, the used data warehouse, etc $\dots$.
Thereafter, we evaluate in Section~\ref{eva:merge} and Section~\ref{eva:rec} the performance of our merge and collaborative-filtering recommendation methods as well as the usability of our collaborative recommendation when visually exploring data warehouses (in Section~\ref{eva:usability}).

Finally, in Section~\ref{sec:final-userstudy}, we evaluate qualitatively the extended version of our framework \framework{}, which includes a collaborative-filtering query recommendation, with a user study. This is done by first comparing it with the first version of our framework \framework{} (discussed in Chapter~\ref{chap:EVLIN}) and by comparing it later with a state of the art visual data exploration system.
