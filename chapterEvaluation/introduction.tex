We dedicate this chapter to the evaluation of the algorithms discussed in Chapter~\ref{chap:EVLIN} that integrates an implementation of our framework (see Chapter~\ref{chap:overview}) and leverages the evolution provenance model presented in Chapter~\ref{chap:evoDM}.


We start by providing a brief description of the experimental setup in Section~\ref{sec:setup}. 
It includes implementation details of our framework implementation \prototype{}.
In Section~\ref{eval-sec:content}, we evaluate our proposed content-based query recommendation approach. Then, we present in Section~\ref{eval-rec:quantification} the evaluation results of various functions implemented to quantify the interestingness of recommended exploration queries. 
Thereafter, we evaluate in Section~\ref{eva:merge} and Section~\ref{subsec:runtimeCollab} the performance of our merge and collaborative-filtering recommendation methods, respectively, the usability of our collaborative recommendation when visually exploring data warehouses  is evaluated in Section~\ref{eva:usability}.
Later, we evaluate in Section~\ref{eval-sec:visRec} the performance of our visualization recommendation approach.
Finally, Section~\ref{sec:final-userstudy} presents a comparative evaluation of our different recommendation approaches and other state-of-the art systems based on a user's study.


Note that this chapter is significantly based on the evaluation result, published in~\cite{Houssem:17:tapp,Houssem:19:adbis,Houssem:19:IS}. Further experiments results are discussed here to provide a more thorough evaluation.
